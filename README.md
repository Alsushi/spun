#### Blog about engineering topics
  This static website is built with Hugo static site generator. It has been seen as an improvement over using a framework.
  Contents are merged from 2 sites: IT blog and CAD blog.
  UI should look the same but UX should be improved.
  Maintainability and content creation should be greatly improved.

##### Theme is Material Design flavored
  Based on materializecss, which is based on NormalizeCSS.
