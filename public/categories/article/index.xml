      <description>Linux bash shell If user account is set to use sh instead of bash some usual commands may not work. * Does up arrow showing the last command? * Does left arrow allow to move cursor? * Does TAB autocompletes commands? One of these points might showcase an incorrect user profile for shell. To fix it chsh -s /bin/bash  The rootcause can be a badly initialised default config for user accounts.</description>

      <description>JavaScript API for Adobe illustrator cc22 Ai can be customized and improved at various levels. A first user-friendly level of automation is called ACTIONS. To sum up it is basically recording what the mouse can do with some hickups. Beware though: some functions are not reachable or glitched. To extend the automation scope of the tool, one can use Adobe API called ExtendScript. Things starts to become interesting as Ai would now react as a Command Line Instrustion.</description>

      <description>What is called &amp;ldquo;PLM&amp;rdquo; exactly? PLM can be referred as tools used in engineering. This term is not widely known, except from commercials whose goal is to sell tools. Indeed, due to the complexity of engineering topics, tools are more and more connected. This starts from compatibility reasons up to complete cloud solution.
The components of a PLM tool Basically you can get 2 main PLM suites: PTC one and Dassault one.</description>

      <title>SSH using root@machine</title>

      <description>Disable root login on SSH To take control on a distant computer on Linux, many system offers a default login by root admin user. Technically you need to know user name and user account password to connect. Therefore anyone willing to connect would just have to guess a password.
what if root access is removed without creating other users? Then server access is lost and would require an intervention to reinstall the system.</description>
