#### What is called "PLM" exactly?
PLM can be referred as tools used in engineering. This term is not widely known, except from commercials whose goal is to sell tools.
Indeed, due to the complexity of engineering topics, tools are more and more connected. This starts from compatibility reasons up to complete cloud solution.
#### The components of a PLM tool
Basically you can get 2 main PLM suites: PTC one and Dassault one.
Some useful components can be sorted in categories:
* CAD : the usual 2D/3D tool that manages digitalized versions of real world objects with eventually some attached documents: drawings, bill-of-material, certifications
* PDM : how to get version control and release process automated. This is also where legacy stuff is ordered.
* DMU : solutions to handle mockup rendering. Large mockup synchronization and rendering need to be optimized.
* CM : Managing versions for customers. Think of fleets.
* ShopFloor : This is where you model a plant to try to reproduce manufacturing issues.
* Simulation : Digital mockups are ready to get crushed.
